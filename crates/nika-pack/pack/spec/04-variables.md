## The one syntax · `${{ ... }}`

```yaml
# Inside a string
prompt: "Summarize · ${{ inputs.topic }}"

# Inside a value position
with:
  data: ${{ tasks.research.output }}

# Inside a condition (local namespaces · [03 §when](./03-dag.md))
when: ${{ with.coverage > 80 }}

# Inside an array
tools:
  - ${{ const.tool_a }}
  - ${{ const.tool_b }}
```

If you have used GitHub Actions, this is the same. If you have not, the rule is simple · **anywhere you want a value resolved at task dispatch time, wrap it in `${{ }}`**.

**What's inside `${{ }}` is [CEL](https://cel.dev)** (Common Expression
Language · the validated, non-Turing-complete standard used by Kubernetes,
Envoy, and gRPC). A bare reference like `${{ inputs.topic }}` is a CEL identifier
path that evaluates to its value; a condition like `${{ with.coverage > 80 }}`
is a CEL boolean. One expression language, everywhere: Nika does not invent a
DSL. See [03-dag.md](./03-dag.md#expression-language--a-documented-subset-of-cel) for the v0.1 CEL subset.

## The 5 namespaces

```
${{ inputs.X }}            typed workflow input          (declared in envelope `inputs:` · supplied by the caller at launch, or by its own `default:`)
${{ const.X }}             named constant                 (declared in envelope `const:` · a fixed value baked into the workflow)
${{ secrets.X }}           masked secret reference        (vault-backed · never in logs)
${{ with.X }}              task-level scope               (declared per-task `with:` block · the bindings ARE the data edges)
${{ tasks.X.output }}      task record reference          (or .status · .error · .duration_ms · the CLOSED projection set · BOUNDARY surfaces only — see below)
```

Five namespaces. That's it.

The first three — `inputs` · `const` · `secrets` — are the **value
authorities**, the closed family every workflow value is declared under
(LAW-SURFACE-0201 · one authority, one spelling, no alias). `with` and
`tasks` are the **runtime namespaces** (task-scope bindings and settled task
records) — legal in `${{ }}`, never value authorities.

> **⚰️ `config` was the fourth, and it is dead (2026-08-12).** Measured:
> **zero** usage in real work; its `default:` was its **only** possible
> source (nothing outside the file could supply it — `--var` reaches
> `inputs:` only); and under the taint lattice `${{ config.p }}` and
> `${{ inputs.p }}` produced **the same** `NIKA-AUTH-008` by the same taint
> path — **indiscernible**. The cell it occupied (nobody supplies it ×
> treated as untrusted) was a constant the checker was being asked to treat
> as hostile. A deployment knob is now an `inputs:` entry with
> `required: false` and a `default:`. A `${{ config.X }}` read refuses
> `NIKA-VALUES-003`, which teaches the three-authority family.

> **Dead forms (refused with a classification teaching · the E-split).**
> The pre-flip `vars:` and `env:` envelope fields are dead: a `vars:` block
> refuses with `NIKA-VALUES-001`, an `env:` block with `NIKA-VALUES-002`,
> and a `${{ vars.X }}` / `${{ env.X }}` read with the same codes. Each
> old use **classifies** into the authority its role commands — a typed
> parameter is an `inputs:` declaration, a fixed value a `const:` entry,
> non-sensitive runtime configuration an `inputs:` declaration with
> `required: false` and a `default:`, a governed store reference a
> `secrets:` entry (classify-not-rename · never a bulk rename). A
> value-namespace read outside the three-authority family
> (`${{ params.X }}` and friends) refuses with `NIKA-VALUES-003`.

### The reference boundary · where `tasks.*` may appear

Since W2 « the flow », the `tasks` namespace is **boundary-only**. A
`${{ tasks.X.* }}` reference is legal in exactly five places ·

| surface | why it is a boundary | graph effect |
|---|---|---|
| `with:` values | the binding imports the data — **the binding IS the edge** | one typed edge per reference ([03 §with](./03-dag.md)) |
| `with:` values, plural · `${{ group.<name> }}` | the fan-in fold imports a whole declared set — **this is the ONLY door it has**, tighter than `tasks.*` | one `fan-in` edge per declared member ([03 §group](./03-dag.md#group--optional--fan-in-membership--the-plural-of-a-data-edge)) |
| `after:` keys | the entry names the producer | one control edge per entry |
| `on_error.recover:` | a fallback reads a settled record | a recovery edge (parking · `NIKA-DAG-004`) |
| an `unwind` task body | cleanup reads the **producer it unwinds** — the ONLY legal target there (a sibling may still be running · the read would race) | none (the E_f attachment never enters `G_p`) |
| workflow `outputs:` | the run's exports read the settled world | none (everything is terminal at read time) |

**Everywhere else — verb fields (`prompt:` · `command:` · `args:` · …),
`when:`, `for_each:` — a `tasks.*` reference is refused at parse time**
(`NIKA-VAR-021` · `validation_error`) with a machine-applicable fix:
**hoist it into `with:`** and read the binding ·

```yaml
# ❌ NIKA-VAR-021 — the body reads the global namespace
summarize:
    infer:
      prompt: "Summarize · ${{ tasks.fetch.output }}"

# ✅ the fix `nika check --fix` applies
summarize:
    with:
      article: ${{ tasks.fetch.output }}
    infer:
      prompt: "Summarize · ${{ with.article }}"
```

The task body is a **pure function of its declared inputs** (`with` · the
three value authorities `inputs` · `const` · `secrets` · the loop
locals): every cross-task dependency is
visible at the boundary, named, and typed by its edge role. Nothing else
reads another task.

> **Bare `tasks.X` is not a value (normative · D2 · #75).** The task
> result is a record; its observable projections are the CLOSED set
> `.output` (the value) · `.status` (terminal enum) · `.error` ·
> `.duration_ms` — additions are a spec minor. An UNPROJECTED
> `${{ tasks.X }}` in any value position is a `validation_error`
> (`NIKA-VAR` · « the envelope is not a value — pick `.output` »):
> before 0.103 it silently denoted the whole envelope, the source of
> the golden-drift trap engine#524 had to teach around. No aliases —
> one meaning per spelling.

> **`group.<name>` is not a namespace either.** It is the **plural reader
> of `tasks`** — same runtime family, one door instead of five (a `with:`
> value · everywhere else is `NIKA-VAR-021`). It denotes a set of task
> records, so it belongs beside `tasks` rather than beside the three value
> authorities, and the count below is unchanged. See
> [03 §group](./03-dag.md#group--optional--fan-in-membership--the-plural-of-a-data-edge)
> for the record shape and the `fan-in` pass-set.

> **Loop-locals are not a namespace.** Inside a `for_each` task body, two
> extra identifiers are in scope: `${{ item }}` (the current element) and
> `${{ index }}` (its 0-based position). They are **loop-scoped locals**, alive
> only within that task's body, not global namespaces. So the count stays
> « <!-- canon:namespaces -->5<!-- /canon --> namespaces » + the for-each locals where a loop is present.

**Shadowing is structurally impossible.** Every namespace is reached
through its explicit prefix (`inputs.` · `const.` · `secrets.` ·
`with.` · `tasks.`): an `inputs.item` and the loop-local `item` never collide
(one is `inputs.item` · the other is bare `item`), a task may be named
`item` (`tasks.item.output` is unambiguous), and `with.X` never hides an
`inputs.X`. The only bare identifiers in the language are the two
loop-locals, and `for_each` does not nest within a task, so there is no
scope chain · no resolution-order subtleties · nothing to shadow. This
is by construction, not by rule.

### `${{ inputs.X }}` · typed workflow inputs

Declared once in the envelope · immutable across the workflow run · every
entry is a **typed declaration** whose `type:` speaks the full TypeExpr of
[09-types.md](./09-types.md) (the flat 6-enum is dead · `bool` is the one
boolean spelling) — validation + schema generation for callable workflows
(see [01-envelope.md](./01-envelope.md#inputs--optional--typed-workflow-inputs)) ·

```yaml
nika: research-pipeline

inputs:
  topic:
    type: string
    required: true                   # the caller MUST supply it
    description: "Subject to research"
  paragraphs:
    type: integer
    default: 5                       # MUST conform to type: (checked · NIKA-DEFAULT-001)

tasks:
  research:
    infer:
      prompt: "Research · ${{ inputs.topic }} · in ${{ inputs.paragraphs }} paragraphs"
```

A `required: true` input has no default: the caller must supply it at
launch. To supply or override an input ·
`nika run flow.nika.yaml --var topic="CEL subsets in 2026"` (repeatable ·
engine CLI concern). A `--var` value overrides the declared default and
satisfies a `required: true` input · an undeclared key is refused before the
run. See [01-envelope.md](./01-envelope.md#inputs--optional--typed-workflow-inputs)
for the launch contract.

**Every bound input carries its ORIGIN** (normative) · a value is not
only *what* it is, it is *where it came from*, and the run records
which ·

| Origin | The channel that supplied the value |
|---|---|
| `cli-operator` | `--var name=value`, typed by a human at a terminal |
| `ci-context` | `--var name=value` arriving through a pipeline — the caller is not a human |
| `api-caller` | an explicitly supplied value arriving through a programmatic launch API, including Serve |
| `env` | `--var name=@env:VAR` · the **declared** environment channel, read through its explicit spelling |
| `file` | the workflow's own declared `default:` filled the input |

An API-supplied value keeps `api-caller` through queueing, restart and
execution. A default filled from the workflow keeps `file`, even when an
API launched the run. The origin names the supplying **channel**, not an
authenticated identity, a human approval, or a grant. It MUST NOT be
inferred from an ambient CI variable or attributed to `cli-operator`
merely because a server uses the engine's command or library internally.

API values are typed data. A string beginning with `@env:` or containing
`${{ ... }}` MUST NOT be interpreted as a request to read host credentials
or evaluate an expression. The explicit CLI environment channel above
does not implicitly extend to API payloads. These rules add no workflow
key and no authority to the declared boundary.

The origin **is journaled at boot** — it rides the prologue manifest
([17 §the prologue](./17-trace.md)) — and from there rises into the run's
evidence pack, so a proof answers *who supplied this* and not merely
*what was supplied*. *(Measured 2026-08-13 · `nika 0.108.0`: `--var
qui=…` at a terminal journals `inputs: {"qui":"cli-operator"}` and the
pack reads `inputs.origins` with `source: "journal"`. The run RECEIPT —
`receipt_format: 1`, whose folded shape is [15 §the one receipt](./15-proof.md)
— does not carry origins; the claim belongs to the journal and the pack
it feeds.)* The distinction that carries the
weight is `env`: an environment value enters through a spelling the
author wrote, never through an ambient guess — the same law the
[`permits.env`](./01-envelope.md) passthrough enforces for child
processes, applied to the launch surface. A pipeline and a person are
likewise not the same caller, and a receipt that conflated them would
lose the fact an auditor is looking for.

### `${{ const.X }}` · named constants

```yaml
const:
  retries: 3                                # bare literal
  output_dir: "./output"
  window:                                   # typed constant · value MUST conform to type:
    type: integer
    value: 30

tasks:
  note:
    infer:
      prompt: "Keep the ${{ const.retries }} retries in ${{ const.output_dir }}"
```

`const` holds the fixed values baked into the workflow: either a **bare
literal** (any YAML value) or a **typed constant** `{ type, value }` whose
`value:` MUST conform to its `type:` (checked · `NIKA-DEFAULT-001`). An
object carrying BOTH `type` and `value` keys is the typed form; an object
missing either key is a bare literal object constant (the discriminator ·
so a literal like `config: { type: "custom" }` is never misread). Constants
are immutable across the run and are never caller-supplied: a value the
caller must be able to override is an `inputs:` declaration, not a constant.

### `${{ with.X }}` · task-level scope

Declared per-task · resolves at task dispatch time · the task's **import
surface** ·

> **`with:` is the data boundary, not sugar.** A `${{ tasks.X.* }}`
> reference lives ONLY in `with:` (and the other boundary surfaces above):
> each such binding creates one typed edge, and the body consumes the
> binding by its local name. `with:` is where a task's inputs are visible
> at a glance — and where the graph gets its data edges
> ([03 §with](./03-dag.md)).

```yaml
summarize:
    with:
      content: ${{ tasks.research.output }}    # value edge · research → summarize
      style: "concise"                         # literal · no edge
    infer:
      prompt: "Summarize in ${{ with.style }} style · ${{ with.content }}"
```

A binding whose evaluation errors settles the task `failure` — `on_error:`
is NOT consulted (the boundary feeds the verb; the armor covers the verb ·
[03 §gate algebra](./03-dag.md#the-gate-algebra-v2-normative)).

### `${{ tasks.X.output }}` · task record reference

Reference an upstream task's output (or status · error · duration_ms) —
at the boundary ·

```yaml
deploy:
    after: { test: success }                              # strict gate · no data from test
    with:
      coverage: ${{ tasks.test.output.coverage }}         # value edge · read the number
      artifact: ${{ tasks.build.output.artifact_path }}   # value edge · build → deploy
    when: ${{ with.coverage > 80 }}                       # local business condition
    exec:
      command: ["./deploy.sh", "${{ with.artifact }}"]
```

`tasks.X` is the task **result record**: a CEL object, NOT the bare output
value. Always write `.output` for the value · the record's fields are ·

```
${{ tasks.X.output }}                the verb's output (string · object · or bytes · per verb · see 02)
${{ tasks.X.status }}                success | failure | skipped | cancelled  (closed enum · v1)
${{ tasks.X.error }}                 typed error record · present iff status == failure (see 05)
${{ tasks.X.started_at }}            RFC 3339 start timestamp
${{ tasks.X.ended_at }}              RFC 3339 end timestamp
${{ tasks.X.duration_ms }}           execution time · integer milliseconds
${{ tasks.X.<name> }}                a named extract: binding (jq · see below)
```

#### Defined-null reads (normative · the branch-join unlock)

Reading a field of a task that reached a terminal state **never errors**:
absent values are **`null`**, deterministically ·

```
tasks.X.output   of a skipped task        → null   (incl. empty-collection for_each)
tasks.X.output   of a cancelled task      → null
tasks.X.error    when status != failure   → null   (EXCEPT on_error.skip · error stays · see 05)
tasks.X.<name>   bindings of a skipped/cancelled task → null
```

`null` is a CEL literal (`with.x != null` is in the v0.1 subset) and
a JSON value (jq's `select(. != null)` filters it). This makes the
**diamond-join** canonical · two exclusive `when:` branches + a join that
takes whichever ran ·

```yaml
pick:
    with:                                     # value edges pass on skipped · the skipped one is null
      prod: ${{ tasks.build_prod.output }}
      dev: ${{ tasks.build_dev.output }}
    invoke:
      tool: nika:jq
      args:
        input: [ "${{ with.prod }}", "${{ with.dev }}" ]
        expression: "[ .[] | select(. != null) ] | first"
```

**One obvious way · no bare alias.** `${{ tasks.X }}` is the whole result
object · the output is ALWAYS `${{ tasks.X.output }}`: there is no `tasks.X`
== output shortcut (it would make `tasks.X` both a scalar and a record · which
CEL cannot type). This matches every workflow engine · GitHub Actions
`steps.X.outputs` · Argo node context · Temporal result-vs-state · the task
result is a record, never a scalar masquerading as the namespace.

### Static binding validation against a declared `schema:` (normative)

When the producing task declares a structured-output **`schema:`** (an
`infer:` or `agent:` task · [02](./02-verbs.md)), the shape of
`tasks.X.output` is KNOWN at parse time, so a reference path INTO that
output (`${{ tasks.X.output.entities }}`) is statically checkable. The
authoring contract ·

- An engine **SHOULD** validate `tasks.X.output.<path>` references against
  the declared schema at parse time (the misspelled-key class is caught
  before any model is called).
- An engine **MUST reject invalid paths** · `NIKA-VAR-003` ·
  `variable_error`. A path step is *invalid* when ·
  1. a **member step** lands on a schema level that **declares
     `properties:`** and does NOT list the key — declaring properties
     CLOSES the level for binding (operator lock 2026-07-30 · strict by
     default, one voice with the `returns:` walk below). The level opens
     back up ONLY explicitly: `additionalProperties: true` (or a schema
     object for extras) makes undeclared siblings legal again.
     (`additionalProperties: false` on a level with no `properties:`
     also closes it — the declared empty object.)
  2. a **member step** lands on a level whose `type` excludes `object`;
  3. an **index step** lands on a level whose `type` excludes `array`.
- The static walk covers the v0.1 subset **`properties` · `items` ·
  `type` · `additionalProperties`** only. Any other construct at a level
  (`$ref` · `oneOf` / `anyOf` / `allOf` · `patternProperties` · a missing
  `type` · …) makes that level **open**: the walk stops and the engine
  **MUST NOT** reject anything beneath it.
- A level that declares **no `properties:` at all** (a bare
  `type: object`) is **open**: nothing is declared, so nothing can be
  contradicted — paths beneath it are never statically rejected.
- Tasks with NO declared schema (every `exec:` / `invoke:` task · an
  `infer:` without `schema:`) are dynamic: paths into their output are
  never statically rejected (a wrong path surfaces at run time as
  `NIKA-VAR-001`).

The balance is deliberate (2026-07-30 · supersedes the earlier
"only `additionalProperties: false` closes" reading): where the author
declared NOTHING, the check stays **sound** — open levels and dynamic
producers are never refused. Where the author DECLARED the shape, the
declaration is a contract — reading an undeclared sibling of declared
keys is the misspelled-key class and refuses loudly, with a one-line
fix either way (declare the key, or open the level with
`additionalProperties: true`). Note the runtime nuance this owns: JSON
Schema itself treats an absent `additionalProperties` as permissive at
run time, and that runtime semantic is unchanged — the static BINDING
law is stricter than the runtime validator on purpose (catching typos
before any model is called is the point of declaring a schema).

**`returns:` sharpens the walk (normative · [09-types.md](./09-types.md)).**
When the producer declares a `returns:` type instead of a raw `schema:`,
the walk runs on the type with **full precision**: the v1 type grammar
has no open construct, so every level is walkable — a member outside a
closed object is `NIKA-VAR-003` (the same code · one voice), and only
`additional: true` or an `Unknown` producer opens a level. The raw
`schema:` hatch keeps the weaker subset walk above.

### `${{ secrets.X }}` · masked secret reference

```yaml
secrets:
  api_key:
    source: vault
    key: prod/anthropic/api-key
    egress: [{ to: "nika:fetch", host: "api.anthropic.com" }]
headers:
  Authorization: "Bearer ${{ secrets.api_key }}"
```

A secret is always a **reference to a store** (the local `nika-vault` by
default), declared in the envelope `secrets:` block, never an inline
literal. The engine **masks** every resolved `secrets.X` value in logs,
traces, and journal events (it renders as `••••••`). This `inputs` / `secrets`
split is the modern secure-workflow default: non-sensitive values in `inputs`,
masked references in `secrets`.

> **The masking boundary (normative).** Masking covers the engine's OWN
> observability surface: logs · traces · journal · the `nika:inspect`
> output. It does NOT follow a secret value that the AUTHOR routes into a
> subprocess or tool that then re-emits it: a `secrets.X` put into
> `exec.env` (or a `nika:fetch` header) which the command echoes to stdout
> is captured verbatim into `tasks.X.output` and flows downstream like any
> other data: the engine cannot know that captured string IS the secret.
> **The contract:** the engine masks what IT prints; the author owns what
> they pipe a secret INTO. The `nika check` pre-flight flags **every**
> unsanctioned `secrets.X` flow into an effect (`exec` · `invoke` — and the
> provider-egress sinks `infer` / `agent`, where a secret in a prompt leaves
> the run to a third party), so the leak is caught statically before the
> run, not after. A legitimate flow is **sanctioned where the secret is
> declared** — the `egress:` list on the secret (the example above · full
> grammar in [01-envelope §egress](./01-envelope.md)): declassification is
> the owner's act, co-located with the data, never a property of the sink.

---

## Extraction bindings · `extract:`

Use `extract:` to define **named bindings** extracted from a task's raw response via a **jq expression** (the one data language). These bindings appear in the task's typed output and are referenced as `${{ tasks.X.<name> }}` ·

```yaml
api_call:
    invoke:
      tool: "nika:fetch"
      args:
        url: "https://api.example.com/v1/users"   # returns JSON · extract: jq extracts
    extract:
      user_count: ".data.users | length"
      first_user: ".data.users[0]"
      user_emails: "[.data.users[].email]"   # [...] collects the stream into an array
```

Downstream ·

```yaml
notify:
    with:
      user_count: ${{ tasks.api_call.user_count }}    # value edges · the bindings are the edges
      emails: ${{ tasks.api_call.user_emails }}
    infer:
      prompt: |
        We have ${{ with.user_count }} users.
        Emails · ${{ with.emails }}
```

#### Raw output vs named bindings · dual-accessible

When a task has an `extract:` block defining named bindings · downstream
access is **dual-accessible** ·

```yaml
api_call:
    invoke:
      tool: nika:fetch
      args: { url: "..." }
    extract:
      body: .body
      http_status: .status     # NOT `status:` — that name is reserved (the task's own .status)
```

Downstream (each form imported through a consumer's `with:` · the
reference boundary) ·

```yaml
# Raw output (whole structure · pre-binding extraction)
${{ tasks.api_call.output }}             # full raw JSON · including all fields the verb returned

# Named bindings (defined in extract: block above) · value-role fields
${{ tasks.api_call.body }}               # jq .body  · the response body
${{ tasks.api_call.http_status }}        # jq .status · the HTTP status field
${{ tasks.api_call.status }}             # RESERVED · the task's own status (success|failure|…) · NOT a binding · terminal-observation role
```

**Rules** ·
- `tasks.X.output` ALWAYS returns the raw output (unmodified value
  returned by the verb · before any binding extraction)
- `tasks.X.<name>` for any `<name>` declared in `extract:` block returns
  the extracted jq result
- `<name>` collisions with reserved words `output` · `status` · `error` ·
  `started_at` · `ended_at` · `duration_ms` are forbidden at parse time
  (`NIKA-PARSE` · `validation_error`: the rule is structural · schema-checkable
  via `propertyNames` · `NIKA-VAR-NNN` stays reserved for reference *resolution*
  and binding *evaluation* errors)
- If no `extract:` block · only `tasks.X.output` is accessible (named
  bindings are an opt-in convenience)

### Path grammar · jq (the one data language)

Output binding uses a **jq expression**: the SAME jq as the `nika:jq` builtin.
Nika has ONE data extraction-and-transform language (jq), **not two**: the former
RFC 9535 JSONPath was dropped because jq is a superset (any JSONPath query + more)
and a workflow language must not force the author (or an LLM) to choose between
two extraction syntaxes (SOTA « one obvious way · ≤2 expression layers »). The two
expression layers are **CEL** (inside `${{ }}` · conditions + value substitution)
and **jq** (inside `extract:` bindings + `nika:jq` · extraction + transform).
Reference engines use `jaq` (Rust jq) so paths behave identically everywhere.

v0.1 jq conformance subset (every engine MUST support) ·

```
.<name>                    object member
.<name>[<index>]           array index
.<name>[]                  iterate all elements (jq `.[]` · was JSONPath `[*]`)
.a.b.c                     deep path
. | map(...) | select(...) jq pipeline for reshaping / filtering
```

The subset above is the portability floor every engine MUST support. Full jq
(the `jaq` Rust impl · « full stdlib ») MAY be used **minus what the next
section refuses** (D-2026-08-11-N26 · ambient reads and the wall clock): it is
the single data extraction-and-transform language (`extract:` bindings + the
`nika:jq` builtin). ⚠️ *Full-minus-a-prose-list is a floor, not a ceiling.* The
ceiling is a named, versioned grammar — `jq-subset/0.1`, the sibling of
[`cel-subset/0.1`](./03-dag.md) — defined by the normative EBNF below
(D-2026-08-11-N31). The grammar is written; enforcement of its bounded syntax
remains the target described in the implementation-status note below. The
portable floor does not replace that normative ceiling.

##### Formal grammar · jq v0.1 subset (normative · grammar version `jq-subset/0.1`)

Prose + examples are not re-implementable; this EBNF is. A conformant engine
parses exactly this grammar in an `extract:` binding and in `nika:jq` (it is a
strict subset of jq: **any full jq parser accepts every expression below**) ·

```ebnf
program  = pipeline ;
pipeline = alt , { "|" , alt } ;
alt      = cmp , { "//" , cmp } ;             (* alternative · the // operator *)
cmp      = sum , [ cmpop , sum ] ;            (* at most ONE comparison · non-associative *)
cmpop    = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ;
sum      = term , { ( "+" | "-" ) , term } ;
term     = unary , { ( "*" | "/" ) , unary } ;
unary    = [ "-" ] , postfix ;
postfix  = primary , { suffix } ;
suffix   = "." , IDENT
         | "[" , [ pipeline ] , "]"           (* index · [] iterates · NO slice in 0.1 *)
         | "?" ;                              (* optional · swallows the type error *)
reduce   = "reduce" , postfix , "as" , "$" , IDENT ,
           "(" , pipeline , ";" , pipeline , ")" ;   (* bounded fold · the stream IS the bound *)
format   = "@" , ( "base64" | "base64d" | "text" | "json" | "csv" | "tsv" | "uri" ) ;
primary  = "."                                (* identity *)
         | "." , IDENT
         | call | literal | object | array
         | reduce | format
         | "$" , IDENT
         | "(" , pipeline , ")" ;
call     = FUNC , [ "(" , pipeline , { ";" , pipeline } , ")" ] ;
object   = "{" , [ pair , { "," , pair } ] , "}" ;
pair     = ( IDENT | STRING ) , [ ":" , pipeline ] ;
array    = "[" , [ pipeline ] , "]" ;
literal  = NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "null" ;
```

`FUNC` is the **closed** set ·

```
length · keys · values · has · type · not · empty · error
map · map_values · select · add · join · split · flatten · range
sort · sort_by · group_by · unique · unique_by · reverse
first · last · min · max · min_by · max_by · any · all
to_entries · from_entries · with_entries · del · paths
tostring · tonumber · tojson · fromjson · getpath · setpath · leaf_paths
ascii_downcase · ascii_upcase · ltrimstr · rtrimstr · startswith · endswith
floor · ceil · fabs
```

**The set is deliberately small, and small is the safe direction**: a minor
version may only ADD (same law as `cel-subset/0.1`), so a name omitted here
costs one amendment while a name admitted early can never be withdrawn.

Derived from the corpus, not invented: over **41 programs** in the shipped and
internal corpora, the functions actually used are `map · sort · last ·
fromjson · join · length`, plus paths, the pipe, object/array construction and
arithmetic. Everything above is that set plus its obvious companions.

**What the grammar refuses BY CONSTRUCTION, and why ·**

| Absent | Why |
|---|---|
| `recurse` · `..` · `while` · `until` · `repeat` | non-termination · a binding must be decidable at check |
| `def` | user-defined recursion re-introduces the same |
| `env` · `$ENV` · `input` · `inputs` · `input_filename` | ambient reads · the law above |
| `debug` · `stderr` | writes outside the value |
| `halt` · `halt_error` | process control · a data expression does not end a run |
| `test` · `match` · `sub` · `gsub` · `splits` · `scan` | regex · data-dependent blowup · deferred to a minor that pairs them with a bounded engine, not banned on principle |
| slices `.[a:b]` | omitted for 0.1 only · a minor may add |

Clock names are deliberately absent from that refusal table. `now` ·
`localtime` · `strflocaltime` are **accepted and rebound** to the run-start
value/UTC projection; `gmtime` · `mktime` · `strftime` are pure conversions
over supplied data. None reads the host clock or timezone.

⚠️ **A grammar bounds the SHAPE, never the MAGNITUDE.** `[range(1e9)]`
parses clean and still materialises a billion elements. That is the runtime
step budget's job (D-2026-08-11-N32), and the two ceilings are not
interchangeable: the static one buys **termination**, the runtime one buys
**size**. Neither alone is enough.

#### An expression sees only its input (normative · D-2026-08-11-N26)

> **The world of a data expression is the value it is given, and nothing
> else.** Not the process, not an ambient clock, not the disk, not the
> environment. The immutable run-start value is an explicit engine input.
> The control expressions of [03 §CEL](./03-dag.md) obey the same law: their
> world is the bindings they are given.

This is what makes the surrounding closure real. A data expression cannot name
a host, a path, a program or a tool — those are literal in `permits:`. It
cannot decide whether a task runs — that is CEL, and CEL is non-Turing. It
carries no effect of its own. **What remains is a transformation from a value
to a value, and that is the whole of its power.** The language is not closed
because it forbids expression; it is closed because an expression cannot
*reach* anything.

Two consequences, both normative:

- **Ambient reads are refused.** A program that reads the process environment
  (`env`, `$ENV`), the input filename, or the standard input reaches outside
  its value. ⚠️ **Measured 2026-08-11 on a shipped engine: `env.NAME` returned
  the ambient value under an absent `permits:` block and again under an
  explicit empty `permits.env`, while the static check reported the body as
  pure compute from which nothing escapes.** The reach is bounded — such a
  program is a literal in the reviewed file and cannot be interpolated from a
  model's output (`NIKA-VAR-005`) — but a computation that reads the ambient
  environment is not pure, and the certificate said it was.
  ✅ **ENFORCED since 2026-08-15.** Re-measured that day on the three authority
  shapes: `env.NAME` is refused at `nika check` with `NIKA-VAR-005` under an
  absent `permits:` block, under an explicit empty `permits.env`, AND under a
  granted `permits.env` — a grant does not turn it back on, because
  `permits.env` passes an environment to a process the workflow SPAWNS and an
  in-process expression is not that process. The mechanism is the subtraction
  itself: `env` is withheld from the function set every jq seam hands the
  compiler, so the refusal belongs to the compiler rather than to a scanner,
  and the three seams (the `nika:jq` builtin · `extract:` bindings · the static
  compile-check) read ONE list. `$ENV` was already refused by jaq's own
  compiler and still is.
  ✅ **The remaining effect classes are enforced in v0.115.** Host diagnostic
  and process-control symbols are withheld by that same policy; clock forms
  follow the rebinding rule in the next bullet rather than subtraction.
- **The clock is an input, never an ambient** (D-2026-08-11-N27). `now` and
  its relatives resolve to the exact run's start instant stamped on
  `WorkflowStarted`, so that a replay yields the same value forever. Reading
  the wall clock would make the same file pass on a fast machine and fail on
  a slow one — the property a replay exists to deny. A long task therefore
  sees the START instant, not its own; that is the price of determinism and it
  is the correct one. The runtime mints this instant once at the execution
  boundary; composition does not sample it independently.

**Why the layer is not simply removed.** The need to reshape a value does not
disappear with it: an author denied this layer reaches for `exec:` and a real
subprocess, which is strictly worse. The bounded expression layer is what
*prevents* the escape to the shell. Subtracting without replacing moves the
hole; it does not close it.

#### Binding rules (single-value · pure-jq)

- **A binding resolves to exactly ONE value.** A jq program emits a *stream*:
  `.users[]` yields N separate values, NOT an array. A binding whose program
  emits zero or multiple values is an **evaluation-time error**
  (`NIKA-VAR-002` · the emission count is data-dependent · undecidable at
  parse). The reference linter additionally WARNS at check time
  (`one-obvious-way/009`) on the statically-visible smell (a binding jq
  ending in a trailing iterator `[]` with no collecting `[ … ]` wrapper).
  A jq program that itself errors at runtime is
  `NIKA-VAR-004`. Collect a stream with `[ … ]` (`[.users[].email]` → array)
  · take one with an index (`.users[0]`) or `first(…)`. One obvious way · no
  silent first-match, no implicit array-wrap.

#### `extract:` or `nika:jq` · the choice, decided (normative for linters · 2026-08-11)

| Rule | Instead of | Write |
|---|---|---|
| `one-obvious-way/013` | `invoke: {tool: nika:jq}` reshaping **one** producer's output | an `extract:` binding on that producer |

**They are the same jq over the same value, and until now nothing said which
to reach for** — the only genuine unguarded overlap left in the language. The
rule follows from what each one IS, not from taste ·

- An `extract:` binding is **boundary work**: it costs no task, no wave and no
  node in the graph, it runs per iteration inside a `for_each`, and it carries
  a normative cardinality law (exactly one value · `NIKA-VAR-002`).
- `nika:jq` is **a task**: it has an id, a place in the DAG, its own gate and
  its own timeout — and it can read **several** producers through `with:`,
  which a binding structurally cannot, since a binding sees only the output it
  hangs from.

⇒ **One producer, reshaped: a binding. Two or more, joined: the builtin.** The
builtin stays because the many-input case is real and inexpressible otherwise;
the binding wins the single-input case because a whole task node to rename a
field is a node the graph did not need.
- **An `extract:` jq expression is pure jq over the task's raw output**: it does
  NOT contain `${{ }}` (the two expression layers never nest in one string ·
  CEL reads the namespaces · jq reads the task output). To parametrize an
  extraction by a workflow value, shape the verb's *input* with `${{ }}` ·
  the jq then runs over the result. (Exposing the read namespaces as jq
  variables, `.items[] | select(.id == $inputs.target)`, is a v0.2 candidate ·
  jq-native · additive · NOT in the v0.1 subset.)

---

## Resolution order

When a task is admitted · the engine resolves `${{ ... }}` references in this order ·

1. **Boundary first** · the `with:` bindings materialize (their `tasks.X.field` references read the settled records — this is where the data edges deliver)
2. **`when:`** evaluates over the local namespaces (`inputs` · `const` · `with` · loop locals)
3. **Body** · verb-field expressions resolve (`inputs.X` · `const.X` · `secrets.X` · `with.X` · loop locals — never `tasks.*`)
4. **Single-pass** · a substitution result is NOT re-evaluated (no nested substitution)

If a reference is unresolved · the engine raises a `NIKA-VAR-001` (undefined
variable) error — at the boundary (steps 1-2) it settles the task `failure`
with `on_error:` NOT consulted; in the body (step 3) it is task-stage work,
recoverable by `on_error:` ([03 §task states](./03-dag.md#task-states)).

### Value rendering · object → string

When a `${{ }}` reference resolves to an **object or array** and is substituted
into a **string position** (e.g. inside a `prompt:` or `command:`), it renders
as **compact JSON** · deterministic (object keys sorted · no insignificant
whitespace). Scalars render as their natural string (numbers · booleans ·
`null` → `null`). There are **no template pipe-filters** (`${{ x | json }}` is
NOT a thing · per the §locked substitution surface). To control the rendering,
extract a string with jq in `extract:` (`@json` for JSON text · `tostring` /
`@text` for scalar coercion) and reference that binding. One obvious way ·
implicit compact-JSON by default · explicit jq when you need a specific shape.

A **bytes** output (tool-determined · e.g. MCP image content · a binary
`nika:read`) is **opaque** · it flows tool→tool by reference (a `with:`
binding of `${{ tasks.fetch_img.output }}` → another tool's `content:` arg ·
or a file path for `infer.vision`). Bytes **cannot** be jq-extracted (jq is JSON-only)
nor substituted into a string position: that is an error (`NIKA-VAR-007`) ·
the engine never silently UTF-8-coerces a blob (it would corrupt the data).
For `nika:fetch` and `exec` (no binary value channel · every fetch mode is
text/JSON · `raw` included), binary is **file-mediated** · write to a path,
then read or reference the path. There is no `output_format` field · the
value carries its own type.

---

## Escaping

To embed a literal `${{` in a string · use `\${{` (backslash escape). The engine MUST honor this.

```yaml
infer:
  prompt: "The syntax \\${{ inputs.x }} is how you reference variables."
```

(Note · YAML escaping of backslash · `\\` in double-quoted strings · `\` in single-quoted or block scalars.)

**Backslash runs (normative)** · the escape counts the CONTIGUOUS backslash
run immediately before `${{` · an **odd** run escapes the opener (the island
is literal text; the escaping backslash is consumed) · an **even** run
(including zero) leaves the island **live**. Within that run, each remaining
backslash PAIR renders as one literal backslash; backslashes anywhere else
are ordinary characters (there is no general backslash processing). So
`\${{ x }}` renders the literal `${{ x }}` · `\\${{ x }}` renders one `\`
followed by the RESOLVED island · `\\\${{ x }}` renders one `\` + the
literal `${{ x }}`.

An **unclosed `${{`** (an unescaped opener with no closing `}}`) is rejected at
parse time · `NIKA-VAR-008` · `validation_error`: the substitution surface belongs
to this section, even though the YAML itself parses fine.

---

## Why one syntax everywhere

An earlier draft proposed two syntaxes (`$task_id` in value positions · `{{var}}` inside strings). That was a confusion source · v0.1 unifies on a single `${{ }}` syntax for everything.

Reasons ·

- **One mental model** · same syntax everywhere · low cognitive load (Rams principle 4 understandable)
- **GitHub Actions familiarity** · 30M+ developers already know `${{ ... }}`
- **Composable in any position** · strings · object values · array elements · conditions
- **Unique enough** · escape rarely needed
- **Future-proof** · GitHub Actions has extended this syntax for 8+ years without breaking change

---

## Forward-compat

The `${{ ... }}` substitution surface and the <!-- canon:namespaces -->5<!-- /canon --> namespaces are locked at v1. **Template pipe-filters (`${{ inputs.x | json }}` · `| upper`) are NOT a growth path** (they would duplicate builtins + push CEL toward a string-DSL). Data transforms live in the `nika:jq` builtin; the `${{ }}` surface grows only with CEL-native features: the conditional `?:`, the `has()` presence macro, and the `contains`/`startsWith`/`endsWith` string tests ship in `cel-subset/0.1` ([03 §grammar](./03-dag.md)); `all`/`exists` and `matches()` regex stay reserved for a later additive minor. jq is the single extraction-and-transform language (`extract:` + `nika:jq`).

Out of scope for v0.1 (deferred · see [`08-out-of-scope.md`](./08-out-of-scope.md)) ·
- Expression language (no arithmetic in templates)
- User-defined functions in templates
- Multi-pass substitution
